        <h2>Why Mazzaella?</h2>
        <p>First, what is Mazzaella?<br>    Mazzaella is a genus of a species of seaweed.
            See <a href="https://www.centralcoastbiodiversity.org/splendid-iridescent-seaweed-bull-mazzaella-splendens.html">this</a> article. </p>
        <p>
            Why did I choose the domain name Mazzaella? Because it reminds me of home, the pacific northwest.
            <br>Mazzaella splendens is a beautiful red seaweed. When you view it underwater, it shimmers.

            I, Elliott Claus, am. I grew up on a small island in the Pacific Ocean, Orcas Island, WA.
            I went to college at Walla Walla University and graduated in 2020 with a Bioengineering degree. 
            I worked a summer construction job through high school and college, and for a bit after college. 
            I recently moved to Georgia, accepting a junior developer role at <a href="http://appvizo.com/">AppVizo</a>. 
            I am good at making things happen, keeping cost, time, and quality in mind. You can only have two,
            but I try to optimize as best I can. 
            <br> For fun, I like to play board games, pickleball, and ride my electric unicycle. For entertainment,
            I default to Twitter and YouTube. For society, I mostly spend time with my family and close friends.
